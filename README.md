# NLP-Tweet-Sentiment-Classification

## Overview

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to classify the sentiment of social media posts (specifically **tweets**) as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. The model is built using **Logistic Regression** and utilizes **TF-IDF** for feature extraction from text data. This project aims to demonstrate how sentiment analysis can be applied to understand public sentiment and opinions from social media data.
